## Libraries
Numpy and base python was used for all problems. No extra libraries are needed.

## How to run
Download this directory to the location of your choosing. Navigate to the src/main subdirectory in terminal. Use the command "python assignment_2.py" to compile and run the program.

## Objectives
1. Use Neville's Method to find the 2nd degree interpolating value for an unknown f(x) for a set of data.
2. Use Newton's Forward method to find the polynomial approximations of degree 1, 2, and 3 for a set of data.
3. Using the results from 3, find an approximate value for an unknown f(x).
4. Using the Divided Difference method, find the Hermite Polynomial matrix.
5. Using Cubic Spline Interpolation, solve for Matrix A, Vector b, and Vector x given a set of data.
